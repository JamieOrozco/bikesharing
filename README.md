# Bikesharing

## Overview:

This bike trip analysis was performed to solidify a business proposal for a bike sharing program in Des Moines. 

I used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, I'll create a set of visualizations to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Add these new visualizations to a final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

* Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
* Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
* Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

## Results: 
#### Using Tableau, create visualizations that show:

* How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
* How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
* A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

The data shows that the average ride duration is somewhere between 5-10 minutes. It also shows us that the most popular times is 7-9 in the morning and 4-7 in the evening. Most likely this is correlated with professionals using the bikes to commute to and from their job. This heat map aslo shows us that on the weekends bikes are popular from 8am to 8pm with a slight increase between 11-12. Overall, there is more bike useage on the weekends.

The analysis above shows us the gender breakdown highlighting that the majority of the customers are male. It also shows us the same popular times as mentioned before: 7-9 in the morning and 4-7 in the evening.

The above graph is broken down by customer, subscriber and gender. This support our time theory and gender theory. It also gives us more insight into the most polular day of the weeks. From the data we can see that Sunday and Wednesdays are the least popular days and that Thursday and Friday are the most popular. It also highlights that subscribers use the biles more often. 

## Summary

I suggest two more visualizations showing an interactive map highlighting which pick up and drop off area is used the most and what is the average age of the people that are using the service.
